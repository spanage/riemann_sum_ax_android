Riemann Sum: Android Accessibility Demo
==========================================

The application allows the user to model one of 3 functions in a graph and select the number of rects to approximate the integral using a Riemann Sum. (This demo uses the Left Riemann Sum.)

This app has been made fully accessible to demonstrate the use of just some of Android's accessibility APIs. It demonstrates basic accessibility additions via setting contentDescription thru more advanced accessibility via the new ExploreByTouchHelper class.

For more mobile accessibility, please see the [iOS version of Riemann Sum](https://raw.github.com/spanage/riemann_sum_ax_ios).
